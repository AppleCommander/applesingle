# AppleSingle

This project is an off-shoot of AppleCommander's support for the AppleSingle format in that there are multiple 
Java-based tools that can benefit from a pre-built library to support the AppleSingle format.

# Subprojects

This project is split into two sub-projects:

* [api](api) is the Java API
* [asu](tools/asu) is a command-line tool for manipulating images
